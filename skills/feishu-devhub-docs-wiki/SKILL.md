# Feishu Dev Hub Docs And Wiki

Use Docs/Wiki for long-form context that would make Base records too noisy. Base remains the index; Docs/Wiki are linked artifacts.

## Wiki Structure

Recommended first-level pages:

- `00 Inbox`: temporary notes waiting to become structured records.
- `10 Projects`: one page per project, linked from the `Projects` Base table.
- `20 Bugfix Retros`: long bug narratives worth rereading.
- `30 Playbooks`: expanded runbooks that do not fit in Base.
- `40 Decisions`: architecture and product decisions.
- `50 Maps`: whiteboard landing pages and visual summaries.
- `90 Archive`: stale or superseded artifacts.

## Page Rules

- Every useful page should have a matching `Artifacts` Base record.
- Put summary, project, area, tags, and search keywords into Base.
- Do not rely on Wiki hierarchy as the only retrieval mechanism.
- Avoid dumping raw logs unless they are short and safe.

## Creation Pattern

```bash
lark-cli docs +create --api-version v2 --as user \
  --content '<title>Bugfix Retro: short title</title><p>Summary...</p>'
```

Move into Wiki when needed:

```bash
lark-cli wiki +node-create --as user \
  --space-id "$SPACE_ID" \
  --title "Bugfix Retro: short title" \
  --obj-type docx
```

When official `lark-doc` or `lark-wiki` skills are installed, use them for exact command syntax and permission handling.
